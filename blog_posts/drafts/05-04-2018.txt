There's nothing like taking a plan and completely throwing it out the window. I was going to do a series of posts about jekyll but I got to playing with gatsby.js yesterday. It's much more suited to my current needs. 

Javascript is really more my thing. During my bootcamp we focused on Ruby and Rails with just a little bit of Javascript. And that was mostly jQuery. Towards the end of the six-month program I found myself doing a lot of exploring JS basics as well as the node environment. I felt a lot like Scrooge McDuck in his money pit when I discovered all of the things javascript can do these days. I just wanted to dive deep and swim and revel in it. 

But back to Gatsby. So far what I love most about it are the tutorials. They seem fairly comprehensive as far as an overview goes. I also really like how easy it is to get started. 

If you already have node.js installed it only takes two lines of code. One to install the cli and one to create a boilerplate app. There are also lots of 'starters.' For example, there's the default starter, a blog starter, and a hello world starter that are official. But then there are tons of community made starters as well.
