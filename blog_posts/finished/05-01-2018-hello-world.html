<p>Hi world.</p>
<p>While this is hardly the first blog post that I've written, it's one of the first I've written in quite a few years. I have a single blog post on Medium that I wrote during my bootcamp days that I plan on adjusting, updating and polishing before moving it here, but otherwise, it's been years since I wrote much for the world.
</p>

<p>I'm writing this one now before I get all nervous and decide not to do it yet. I always worry so much about what my blog looks like that I end up not wanting to make posts. In order to combat this, I thought I'd blog about what making a blog is like. If you're reading this on the date it was published, or close to it, it'll look something like this:</p>

<p>It is currently the default theme and even still has boilerplate text in the footer as well as on the about page. This ought to be a bad look. But I've been an educator. I learned so much more about my students levels of comprehension on a topic when I got to watch their process. I also learned so much more by teaching than by simply being a student myself. So I'm hoping that by blogging my way through making this blog, I can pass along some important information for people who want to do something similar. With any luck, we'll all learn something along the way.</p>

<h3>The current plan for posts, subject to change:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Jekyll & github sites setup</li>
  <li>Thoughts on themes</li>
  <li>Theme builder setup</li>
  <li>Design the theme</li>
  <li>Process for building the theme</li>
  <li>Getting theme installed</li>
</ol>
