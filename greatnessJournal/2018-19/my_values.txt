What really matters to me? (follow instructions in journal)

I believe in kindness wherever and whenever possible. But I accept that there are times when people will have lost the ability to be kind, or never had it to begin with. I will do my best to forgive those who have failed to be kind to me in the past. We never really know anyone's full story.

I believe in learning always, whenever possible, for life. My favorite thing to do in the world is learn something. My second favorite thing in the world is teach someone something, watching the joy that comes with comprehension. It's a glorious thing. 

I believe in patience. I fail at it quite a lot, but I believe that patience is a thing worth striving for. There's a relief that comes with no longer being in a hurry for something to happen. Sometimes we can't help but be impatient, such as when someone is severly injured. We'll want anything and everything to happen as fast as it can, but hanging on to at least a shred of the patience will make things easier for anyone involved. 

My why: To learn so that I may teach and enrich.
